       <p>Hi Everyone,

        Nice to meet you! This is Luanyue Sun and you can call me Flora. I am coming from China, while I finished my bachelor degree in the United States. My major was Entertainment and Arts Management in my undergraduate university, and I major in DAMM at King's. I had three internships in China related to media. Unfortunately, I did not have experience about building a website. However, I had tried to post some blogs in the WordPress few years ago.Also, I recently started to learnt how to use Axure to do some simple design. 
        
        I have been to a lot of museums around the world. I did not have favorite one, but I do have my preference that I love contemporary arts! So please do recommend some galleries or museums that collect great contemporary art works to me. I will really appreicate!</p>
