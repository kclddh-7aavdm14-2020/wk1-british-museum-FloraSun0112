       <p>This week I had visited the British Museum official website and this is a wonderful online visit experience. Before I share my thoughts about this visit, I would like to briefly introduce the British Museum to you. This museum was built in 1753 and opened in Montagu House in 1759. </p>
       <p>“The British Museum, in the Bloomsbury area of London, United Kingdom, is a public institution dedicated to human history, art and culture. Its permanent collection of some eight million works is among the largest and most comprehensive in existence, having been widely sourced during the era of the British Empire. It documents the story of human culture from its beginnings to the present.[a] It was the first public national museum in the world.” (Wikipedia)  
       <p>Then, let us take a look of its official website. The British Museum Offical website is made for all visitors, scholars, students to have a better understanding of the museum and its artworks, collections and so on. In the website, people not only can see all artworks, collections online, they also have chance to experience 3D visit online. Also, more detail and information are posted in the website, such as, the location of the museum, office hours. Thus, it is a comprehensive website providing a lot of information to let visitors to know better about the museum. In October 2007, the British Museum launched its online collection (COL), the Web version of its collections database. Starting with two-dimensional artworks (mainly on paper), the collection online project needs to be released in stages over a three-month period. A database of all British Museum collections records years as well as conservation and scientific records. By the end of 2009, the entire database of over 1,700,000 records, covering everything from archaeological, ethnographic and numismatic objects to prints, and spanning the widest range of history and culture, will be available to the public worldwide. The database is not yet complete, as the British Museum publishes on its website an extensive collection of information. However, what remains is mainly a large number of holdings of fragments and documentary prints (e.g. bookplates and merchandise cards), held in two parts for each department. Most of the departments' main collections have been recorded.</p>
       <p>At present, under the situation of pandemic, the website had created several functions for visitors. For instance, I could take a look of a sculpture’s 3D model by clicking in the work. I even feel this 3D model showed me more detail of the artwork than I looked at the artwork in the museum. Overall, this was a great online visit experience. You can visit the British Museum official website if you have any interests of the museum, collection or the artwork.</p>
